# against a signed SHA256SUMS before running it, making the baked key trustworthy —
# and it lets a cautious first-time installer pin the key out of band via
# FIREKEEP_SIGNING_PUB. Best-effort by design: no minisign binary, no baked/provided
# key, or no published .minisig -> skip/warn, never break a bare machine. A PRESENT
# signature that fails to verify is fatal — invalid is tampering, absence is history.
# The placeholder probe is split like the dist-base one so make_release's token
# substitution can't rewrite the comparison itself.
# Skipped entirely under a handed FIREKEEP_SUMS_FILE: the client already did the
# authoritative verification against ITS pinned key, and "under a handed file, do
# not fetch at all" is the contract — fetching the .minisig here would reopen a

# --- 6. standalone CPython + venv, only now that uv is verified --------------
#
# `--clear` recreates the venv IN PLACE, which is required, and the honest reason
# is narrower than it used to be documented as.
#
# WHAT WAS TRIED AND FAILED: provisioning into "${VENV}.new" and renaming it over
# the live tree, to avoid deleting a venv a running session execs from. It looked
# strictly better and it does not work -- A VENV IS NOT RELOCATABLE. `uv venv`
# bakes its own absolute path into pyvenv.cfg and into every console script's
# interpreter line, so after `mv ${VENV}.new ${VENV}` the scripts still point at
# ${VENV}.new/bin/python, which no longer exists. The e2e bootstrap gate caught it
# exactly there:
#     install.sh: 267: .../venv/bin/firekeep: not found   (exit 127)
# A staged venv would need `uv venv --relocatable` or a post-swap rewrite of every
# script; both are more machinery than the problem justifies here.
#
# SO THE REAL EXPOSURE STANDS, and is worth stating rather than hiding: for the
# 30-120s of provisioning, ${VENV} does not exist, and every lifecycle hook execs
# ${VENV}/bin/python -- PreToolUse (blocking, gates every Edit), PostToolUse,
# UserPromptSubmit, SessionStart, Stop, plus three stdio MCP servers on reconnect.
# Those fail with "No such file or directory" for the duration. The hook cores all
# fail OPEN (a missing interpreter blocks nothing), so the cost is lost telemetry
# and a skipped lease check, not a broken session.
#
# WHAT MITIGATES IT, and why background auto-update is still acceptable:
#   * Windows refuses outright when live processes hold the venv (install.ps1),
#     so it is exposed for zero seconds.
#   * On POSIX the window is bounded by one uv provision + two wheel installs.
#   * `firekeep update` run by hand has always had this behaviour; the background
#     path automates the same operation, it does not add a new hazard.
# Narrowing it further belongs with a proper relocatable-venv change, tracked
# rather than half-done here.
#
# --python-preference only-managed is load-bearing on Windows (default discovery
# walks PATH into the dangling Store python3.exe alias) and keeps the contract
# honest here: a "standalone CPython" must never silently bind to whatever pyenv
# shim discovery finds first.
