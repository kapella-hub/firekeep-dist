# Firekeep client bootstrap (macOS / Linux). Fetches uv, provisions a standalone CPython
# into ~/.firekeep/venvs/<version>, installs the client wheel (fetched to a local file and
# checksum-verified against a versioned SHA256SUMS, never installed straight from a URL),
# flips the ~/.firekeep/current symlink to the new venv, then hands off to the wizard.
#
# SIDE-BY-SIDE VENVS (client 0.1.35). Each version's venv is provisioned AT its final
# path venvs/<version> and never moved — a uv venv is not relocatable (pyvenv.cfg and
# every console-script interpreter line bake the absolute path; the 0.1.26 rename
# attempt died on exactly that, see the history note at the provisioning step).
# `current` is a symlink every rendered surface routes through, flipped ATOMICALLY via
# rename(2). Updating therefore never deletes the venv live sessions exec hooks from —
# retiring the 30-120s window where ~/.firekeep/venv did not exist mid-rebuild and
# every lifecycle hook on every live session failed with "No such file or directory".
#
# Requires nothing on the machine but a shell and curl/wget. Deliberately POSIX sh (not
# bash): macOS ships bash 3.2, and Alpine/minimal Linux images ship no bash at all.

# --- 6. standalone CPython + venv AT ITS FINAL VERSIONED PATH ----------------
#
# HISTORY, and the constraint this layout is built around. 0.1.26 tried
# provisioning into "${VENV}.new" and renaming it over the live tree, to avoid
# deleting a venv a running session execs from. It looked strictly better and it
# does not work -- A VENV IS NOT RELOCATABLE. `uv venv` bakes its own absolute
# path into pyvenv.cfg and into every console script's interpreter line, so after
# `mv ${VENV}.new ${VENV}` the scripts still point at ${VENV}.new/bin/python,
# which no longer exists. The e2e bootstrap gate caught it exactly there:
#     install.sh: 267: .../venv/bin/firekeep: not found   (exit 127)
#
# The side-by-side layout is the design that squares that circle: venvs/${V} IS
# the final path — the venv is created here and never moved, so every baked
# absolute path stays true forever, and the thing that changes is only the
# `current` symlink (flipped atomically after the wheels install). The old
# 30-120s window where ${VENV} did not exist and every lifecycle hook on every
# live session failed with "No such file or directory" is gone: the previous
# venv remains fully intact until GC proves nothing needs it.
#
# --clear covers re-provisioning a partial venvs/${V} left by an interrupted
# install (the fast path's health probe deliberately fails those into this
# path). A fresh dir has nothing to clear.
#
# HONEST RESIDUAL: when venvs/${V} is the venv `current` points at (forced
# reinstall, or repairing an unhealthy current version), --clear IS destructive
# to the selected venv. That is why every download and checksum happens above
# this line — the only failures left after the clear are local (uv provision,
# pip). If one still dies, `current` points at a gutted venv until a re-run
# heals it: the fast path's health probe fails the gutted venv straight back
# into this full path. Confined to the explicit repair flow; a normal
# version-changing update never clears anything `current` selects.
#
# --python-preference only-managed is load-bearing on Windows (default discovery
# walks PATH into the dangling Store python3.exe alias) and keeps the contract
# honest here: a "standalone CPython" must never silently bind to whatever pyenv
# shim discovery finds first.

# --- 7. install ALL wheels BY LOCAL FILE PATH, in ONE resolution -------------
# One `uv pip install` for the client + every dex wheel, never one per wheel.
# This is load-bearing, found the hard way on the 1.0.0 release: docdex's wheel
# declares `firekeep-client>=0.1.48`, and `--reinstall` reinstalls the ENTIRE
# resolution set — so a separate docdex step re-resolved firekeep-client from
# the INDEX and silently replaced the local wheel just installed in step 7 with
# whatever PyPI's newest happened to be (a fresh 1.0.0 install shipped 0.1.48).
# With all four local files in one request, each local wheel IS the resolution
# for its own name; only genuine third-party deps come from the index. Every dex
# added to the bundle joins THIS line — never a step of its own, whatever the
# ordering argument for it looks like.
#
# Every dex wheel ships with every install; REGISTRATION (~/.firekeep/dexes.json)
# is what decides whether a dex does anything. Gating the INSTALL instead would
# put a second, unverified download path in front of a user who later opts in —
# the signed supply chain is the thing that must not become optional.

# --- 7d. the install must have produced a runnable firekeep -------------------
# Provisioning can succeed while producing something unusable (a wheel for the
# wrong platform, a truncated interpreter). Checked at the venv's REAL path and
# BEFORE the flip: a broken build must never become `current`, and a session
# started mid-install must never resolve to it. The wizard hand-off is the very
# next act, so checking now converts a confusing exit 127 into a diagnosis at
# the point of failure.

# step left `current` (and every live session) exactly as it was.

# --- 8. hand off to the wizard ----------------------------------------------
# THE curl|sh TRAP: piping this script to `sh` makes the SCRIPT stdin, so the wizard's
# sys.stdin.isatty() is False, every prompt is skipped, and agent_id lands as CHANGEME.
# Re-attach the real terminal explicitly.
#
# The guard TRIES THE OPEN rather than testing the path. `[ -e /dev/tty ] && [ -r /dev/tty ]`
# is NOT a controlling-terminal test: those use access(), and /dev/tty is crw-rw-rw- so it
# exists and is readable even for a process with no controlling terminal. Opening it is what
# fails there (ENXIO) — cron, `docker run` without -t, systemd, many CI runners. A path test
# would take the interactive branch in exactly the headless case it exists to catch, and the
# redirect would then die with a raw shell I/O error instead of falling back cleanly.
#
# The probe must be a SUBSHELL `( : < /dev/tty )`, not a brace group: `:` is a POSIX
# special builtin, and a redirection error on a special builtin makes strictly-POSIX shells
# (dash — i.e. Debian/Ubuntu sh) exit the WHOLE script, status 2, message eaten by the
# 2>/dev/null. Bash-as-sh (macOS) shrugs it off, which is how the brace form survived
# local testing. In a subshell only the subshell dies, so the probe just returns false.
# `|| wizard_exit=$?` keeps a failing wizard from killing the script under
# `set -e` before the GC sweep runs; its exit code is still propagated.
