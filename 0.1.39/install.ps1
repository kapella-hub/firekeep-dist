# Firekeep client bootstrap (Windows). Mirrors bootstrap/install.sh step for step:
# resolve the version, fetch this version's SHA256SUMS once, checksum-verify EVERY
# executable artifact (uv.exe AND the wheel) against it before either is used, provision a
# standalone CPython into ~/.firekeep/venvs/<version>, install the wheel BY LOCAL FILE
# PATH, flip the ~/.firekeep/current junction to the new venv, hand off to the wizard.
#
# SIDE-BY-SIDE VENVS (client 0.1.35). Each version's venv is provisioned AT its final
# path venvs/<version> and never moved — a uv venv is not relocatable (pyvenv.cfg and
# every console-script interpreter line bake the absolute path; the 0.1.26 rename
# attempt died on exactly that, see install.sh's history note). `current` is an NTFS
# junction (works without admin, unlike a directory symlink) that every rendered
# surface routes through. Updating therefore NEVER touches the venv live sessions run
# from: their open handles pin the real files, not the link. This retires the old
# in-place `uv venv --clear` rebuild and with it the "close every agent session"
# requirement and the wall of holder PIDs it printed.
#
# No stdin trap here, unlike the POSIX side: `irm <url> | iex` keeps the console attached to
# the PowerShell process running this script (unlike `curl | sh`, where piping makes the
# SCRIPT ITSELF stdin and silently defeats the wizard's prompts). There is no /dev/tty
# equivalent to reattach and none is needed — do not "fix" this asymmetry.

# the way — this is the step that used to refuse with a wall of holder PIDs, and
# no longer has anything to refuse over. --clear covers re-provisioning a partial
# venvs/<V> left by an interrupted install (the fast path's health probe fails it
# into this full path on purpose).
#
# HONEST RESIDUAL: when venvs/<V> is the venv `current` points at (forced
# reinstall, or repairing an unhealthy current version), --clear IS destructive
# to the selected venv. That is why every download and checksum happens above
# this line — the only failures left after the clear are local (uv provision,
# pip). If one of those still dies, `current` points at a gutted venv until a
# re-run heals it: the fast path's health probe fails the gutted venv straight
# back into this full path. Confined to the explicit repair flow; a normal
# version-changing update never clears anything `current` selects.
#
# The ONE case where live processes can still hold venvs/<V> itself is a
# FIREKEEP_FORCE_REINSTALL of the version `current` points at while sessions run
# it. Summarize the holders BY NAME — never a wall of PIDs — and refuse, because
# clearing a held venv on Windows dies mid-delete and leaves it gutted.
